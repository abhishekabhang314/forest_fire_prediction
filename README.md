# 🌲🔥 Forest Fire Detection Project

This project detects and simulates forest fires using satellite imagery and weather data.  
Built with Python, PyTorch (U-Net), and real geospatial data (Alberta + others).

## 🚀 Features
- Converts PNG + PGW → GeoTIFF
- Extracts fire masks (orange overlay)
- Integrates historical weather data (temperature, humidity, wind)
- Trains a deep learning model (U-Net)
- Predicts and visualizes fire spread
